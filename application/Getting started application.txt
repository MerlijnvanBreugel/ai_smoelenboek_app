Hi there!

Ready for a challenge?
Your team is challenged to an application that leverages the built voice recognition and face transform algorithm.
This application should be shown on the TV at the entrance. 

Align with the other teams to determine how you will connect the different components. 

To reach output within 2.5h, think MVP. What is minimally needed to show a first PoC? 
In the simplest form, it is just a plotting window in Spyder, but you are probably more ambitious than that!

Rutger recommends a flask or streamlit setup. Also, think whether you need real user interaction or only voice control.
