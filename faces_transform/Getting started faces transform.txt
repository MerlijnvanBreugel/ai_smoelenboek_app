Hi there!

Ready for a challenge?
Your team is challenged to build an algorithm that can transform/morph portraits of our colleagues to an art style. 
As input, it should get detected key words from the speech recognition algorithm. 
Based on this, it should display the transformation of the correct colleague and artist. 

It is important to align with the application team how the results are shown. 

To give you a head start, I have already prepared images and preprocessed them. Also, the code for the algorithm is finished (and a bit stolen;))

Tasks:
1. Open the available code: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1LRyIXqyKLscTLrytG8iPIoR6P5djecN2#scrollTo=JT9Mh7OIKsda 
	Login to our micompanycolabpro account to use the GPU. Esm√©e knows how. 
2. Run the code and connect to the Drive. Data is for now stored in my AIAIAI/Stylegan folder.
3. The aligned images and generated images are already prepared, containing a subset of our colleagues and artists. That is enough for now.
	These images are preprocessed to work with stylegan. 
	Images can also be found in the images folder on git.
4. Quickly run through the code. In 2. Style Transfer the real magic happens
	In the final part, a video gif of the style transfer is created. Probably we want to use this for a cool transformation. 
5. Determine the process how you want to show and transform images. 
	In the MVP, I suggest to pre-run a number of combintations of transitions that are stored in seperate video gif files.
6. Build code that uses the input keywords and then displays the right transformation video. 
	You can use the image_list_specs.xlsx file for key words related to the images.
